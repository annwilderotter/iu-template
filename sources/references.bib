	abstract = {The book describes the main aspects of {BGP} (Border Gateway Protocol) and its most important practicalapplications, such as traffic management policies, scalable architectures, stability and security mechanisms,and its role in big Enterprises and {ISP} networks. For each topic covered, also the implementation aspects {inCisco} and Juniper technologies are included, essential to fully understand the main mechanisms of the protocoland its applications. The central idea behind the book is combining theory and practice, to avoid turning it only into a (debatable) presentation of the standard. This is why, apart from explaining in detail and with many examples how the protocol works, and its role in {IP} networks, the book also includes many practicalapplication suggestions, resulting from many decades of experience.Main topics covered:- Fundamentals ({AS}, sessions, messages, attributes, etc.)- Prefix aggregation and filtering- Inbound/outbound routing policies- Scalability, stability and security aspects- Convergence aspects- {BGP} in Enterprise and Service Provider networks- The role of {BGP} in {MPLS} services- Basic and advanced implementation aspects in Cisco {IOS} {XE}/{XR} and Juniper {JUNOS}- {BGP} security aspects- Best implementation practices},

	abstract = {The Lightwave Energy-Efficient Datacenter ({LEED}) project within the {ARPA}-e {ENLITENED} program is developing novel energy-efficient multichannel lightwave networks. These networks are enabled by a new optical “rotor” switch that can reconfigure the network topology in less than 20 µs and a field-programmable-gate-array-based network interface controller called Corundum that can provide precise network-wide synchronization of packets admitted into the lightwave network. Here we review the optical networking research within {LEED} and discuss future directions.},
