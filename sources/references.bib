	abstract = {The Lightwave Energy-Efficient Datacenter (LEED) project within the ARPA-e ENLITENED program is developing novel energy-efficient multichannel lightwave networks. These networks are enabled by a new optical “rotor” switch that can reconfigure the network topology in less than 20 µs and a field-programmable-gate-array-based network interface controller called Corundum that can provide precise network-wide synchronization of packets admitted into the lightwave network. Here we review the optical networking research within LEED and discuss future directions.},

	abstract = {The book describes the main aspects of BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and its most important practicalapplications, such as traffic management policies, scalable architectures, stability and security mechanisms,and its role in big Enterprises and ISP networks. For each topic covered, also the implementation aspects inCisco and Juniper technologies are included, essential to fully understand the main mechanisms of the protocoland its applications. The central idea behind the book is combining theory and practice, to avoid turning it only into a (debatable) presentation of the standard. This is why, apart from explaining in detail and with many examples how the protocol works, and its role in IP networks, the book also includes many practicalapplication suggestions, resulting from many decades of experience.Main topics covered:- Fundamentals (AS, sessions, messages, attributes, etc.)- Prefix aggregation and filtering- Inbound/outbound routing policies- Scalability, stability and security aspects- Convergence aspects- BGP in Enterprise and Service Provider networks- The role of BGP in MPLS services- Basic and advanced implementation aspects in Cisco IOS XE/XR and Juniper JUNOS- BGP security aspects- Best implementation practices},
